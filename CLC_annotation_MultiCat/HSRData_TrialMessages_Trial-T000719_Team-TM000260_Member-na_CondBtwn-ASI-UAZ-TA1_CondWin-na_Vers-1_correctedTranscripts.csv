1,cf11e8be-a5eb-47a9-b0b2-9eeab46ec5d7,BLUE_ASIST2,I engineer engineer here I have rooms with known damage from severe moderate its i3a E2 A2 L1 i2a and A4 so that kind of corresponds with critical victims being likely in those areas I was looking at the the map I think the best route to take would be from a to a A4 and building going wrapping around,02:35:00,3:4,,,,,pre-game
2,2b1467a2-d7f2-4e4f-a0d9-6c3e7b5d658a,BLUE_ASIST2,towards the North and then coming down maybe transporter can go down to the middle section and identify areas where there are critical victims and then we we end on the right side so it's kind of a snake pattern,3:5,03:21:00,,,,,pre-game
